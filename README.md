# ParanormalActivity

Group project requires use of two APIs and demonstration of class curriculum so far. We used Google Maps and Google News API, along with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery to create this application. We hope to be able to improve upon the application's design in the future.
